## What Is iGenics and Why It Exists

iGenics is a vision support dietary supplement. It is designed for adults who want to protect eye health and support clearer vision over time. The product targets eye strain, visual fatigue, and gradual vision decline that often comes with age or heavy screen use.

People now spend more time on phones and computers than ever before. Data from the American Optometric Association shows that adults spend over 7 hours per day on digital screens. This level of exposure increases eye strain and dryness, even in younger adults. That shift explains why vision supplements like iGenics are gaining attention.

iGenics does not claim to cure eye disease. It aims to support eye health using vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts linked to vision care.

## Who Should Look at iGenics Reviews

iGenics reviews often come from people who share similar concerns:

- Blurry vision that comes and goes
- Eye tiredness after screen use
- Trouble seeing clearly in low light
- Aging adults worried about long-term eye health
- Office workers with daily eye strain

It is meant for adults, not children. People with diagnosed eye conditions should speak with a healthcare professional before using any supplement.

## How iGenics Works Inside the Body

iGenics focuses on protecting the eyes from stress and wear. Eyes face daily damage from blue light, pollution, and oxidation. Over time, this stress affects clarity and comfort.

The formula uses antioxidants and nutrients that support eye tissue and blood flow. Antioxidants help neutralize free radicals that damage eye cells. Better circulation supports oxygen delivery to the eyes, which matters for focus and visual sharpness.

Research from the National Eye Institute shows that antioxidants such as vitamins C and E support eye health by slowing oxidative damage. iGenics builds its formula around this idea.

The supplement works slowly. This matters to understand. Vision supplements support the body over weeks, not days. Many iGenics reviews mention gradual improvement rather than sudden changes.

## iGenics Ingredients Breakdown

Understanding ingredients helps separate hype from value. [**iGenics**](http://iginecs.com/) uses a blend of vision-focused nutrients.

### Lutein and Zeaxanthin

These are carotenoids found in the retina. They filter harmful blue light and support visual clarity. Diets rich in these nutrients are linked to better eye health in aging adults.

### Vitamin A

Vitamin A supports night vision and eye surface health. Low levels are linked to poor vision in dim light.

### Vitamin C and Vitamin E

These antioxidants help protect eye cells from oxidative stress. They also support overall eye tissue health.

### Zinc and Copper

Zinc helps transport vitamin A to the retina. Copper balances zinc intake and supports nerve health.

### Bilberry Extract

Bilberry has a long history in eye support. It contains anthocyanins that support circulation in eye tissues and help reduce eye fatigue.

### Ginkgo Biloba

Ginkgo supports blood flow. Better circulation means better oxygen delivery to the eyes, which may help visual comfort.

### Black Pepper Extract

This ingredient helps the body absorb nutrients better. It supports the use of vitamins and plant compounds in the formula.

Each ingredient plays a role. None act as a miracle alone. Together, they support daily eye health.
